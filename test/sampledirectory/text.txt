"Schtitt, whose knowledge of formal math is probably about equivalent to that of a Taiwanese kindergartner, nevertheless
seemed to know what Hopman and van der Meer and Bollettieri seemed not to know: that locating beauty and art and magic
and improvement and keys to excellence and victory in the prolix flux of match play is not a fractal matter of reducing
chaos to pattern. Seemed intuitively to sense that it was a matter not of reduction at all, but—perversely–of expansion,
the aleatory flutter of uncontrolled, metastatic growth–each well-shot ball admitting of n possible responses, n^2
possible responses to those responses and on into what Incandenza would articulate to anyone who shared both his
backgrounds as a Cantorian continuum of infinities of possible move and response, Cantorian and beautiful because
infoliating, contained, this diagnate infinity of infinities of choice and execution, mathematically uncontrolled but
humanly contained, bounded by the talent and imagination of self and opponent, bent in on itself by the containing
boundaries of skill and imagination that brought one player finally down, that kept both from winning, that made it,
finally, a game, these boundaries of self."
